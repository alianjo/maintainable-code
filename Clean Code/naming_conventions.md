# Writing Meaningful Names

## Explanation:
Naming things properly makes code easier to read and maintain. Clear and meaningful names help other developers (and future you) to understand the purpose and functionality of your code more easily.

### Bad Example:

```python
def f(x, y):
    return x * y

Problem: What does f, x, or y represent?

Good Example:

def calculate_area(width, height):
    return width * height
Why is this better?

Function Name: The function name calculate_area clearly describes what the function does.

Variable Names: The variable names width and height clearly define their purpose.

Detailed Explanation:
Function Name: A well-chosen function name indicates what the function does without the need to read its implementation. This is crucial for code readability and maintainability.

Variable Names: Meaningful variable names help to understand what data the variable holds and its role in the function. This reduces the cognitive load on the reader.

Consistency: Consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase make it easier to follow and maintain.

Documentation: Even with good naming, adding comments or documentation can further clarify complex logic or intentions behind the code.

By following these principles, you ensure that your code is easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
