# OOP vs Functional Programming â€“ Key Differences

| **Feature**      | **OOP**                                                  | **Functional Programming**                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**    | Objects & classes                                        | Pure functions                                         |
|                  | Organizes code into objects, with attributes and methods | Organizes code into functions with no side effects     |
| **Data**         | Mutable                                                  | Immutable                                              |
|                  | Allows changing state                                    | Avoids changing state, data can't be modified after creation |
| **Usage**        | Complex systems                                          | Data transformations                                   |
|                  | Best for managing complex systems and relationships      | Best for transforming and processing data              |
